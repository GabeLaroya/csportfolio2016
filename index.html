<h2> Who Am I? </h2>        
        <p> Hi, Im Gabriel Laroya. I am a tenth grader at Summit Rainier High School.
        My whole life I have lived in San Jose, CA.
        I have been blessed with a family that enjoys traveling. Which has taken me 
        to places like: the Phillipines,Virginia, Pennsylvainia, and
        various other states.</p>

        
        <h3>Favorite Things</h3>
        
        <p>
        My two favorite things are food and family. 
        I absolutely love food! My family loves to cook, 
        and I do too. I enjoy food from all around the world,
        and take pleasure from becoming immersed in new cultures.
        My other favorite thing is family, because without them I am nothing.
        They support me in everything I do. My family has such a strong bond,
        which is something some families don't have. 
        I am grateful to be blessed with a life like mine.
        </p>
        
        <h4> 
        Hobbies
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          My hobbies include: Tahitian drumming, and cooking.
          Tahitian drumming is a cultural instrument native to the French Polynesian 
          island of Tahiti. it is usually accompanied by dancing of the same origin.
          The Tahitian orchestra typically consists of wooden drums, some are made with animal skin.
          I enjoy Tahitian drumming, because the intensity and speed of the art is enticing to me.
          I also enjoy cooking. As I said before, my family tends to cook a lot. 
          One of my favorite things to make is crepes. Currently I am trying to learn
          how to cook various Filipino dishes.
